## Tips  
- What you need to do is only replacing `<sub-url>` with your subscription url  
- Configuration `$tash.yaml` is some kind a simple one for noobs or lazies like me  
- All overrides are for `$tash.yaml`  
- Rules in overrides only take effect while proxy group matched  
- A powerful network tool means do not waste so much time on frequently checking  
  Just install, setup, and let it run background
